# ytm - youtube music

A simple CLI YouTube client in Rust â€” search and play YouTube audio/videos or playlists directly in your terminal using [mpv](https://mpv.io/) with interactive selection powered by [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). The project is ispired by excellent [Yutube-TUI](https://github.com/Siriusmart/youtube-tui) project. Motivation for YTM is to have simple head-less client without graphical ui.

## Features

- Search YouTube and interactively pick results with `fzf`
- Play videos or entire playlists directly with `mpv`
- Default mode is Audio-only. Video mode (-v) is optional.
- Background listening mode (-b) doesnt occupy active shell.
- API key is stored locally and prompted automatically if missing
- Built with Rust, with great help from [Amp](https://github.com/ampcode-com), packaged via Nix flake

## API Key Setup

ytm uses the **YouTube Data API v3**.  
You must provide a valid API key from Google Cloud. 

### API key Limitations
Google free plan is limited to 100 searches per day. Repetitive seach queries will be cached locally to minimise API calls.


### Steps to create an API key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
2. Create or select a project.  
3. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3** for your project:
   - APIs & Services â†’ Library â†’ search "YouTube Data API v3" â†’ Enable.
4. Go to **APIs & Services â†’ Credentials**.  
5. Click **+ Create Credentials â†’ API key**.  
   - Copy the generated key.

### Restrict your API key (recommended)
Dont leave your API key unrestricted to prevent unauthorised usage of the key in case of key leakage.

- Under **Key restrictions**, set:
  - **API restrictions** â†’ restrict to *YouTube Data API v3*.  
  - **Application restrictions** â†’  
    - If you always use from home/server â†’ restrict by IP (IPv4 or IPv6 `/64` prefix).  
    - Otherwise, just leave API restriction in place.

## Installation

### NixOS (system-wide)

Add `ytm` as an input in your system flake (`/etc/nixos/flake.nix`):

```nix
ytm.url = "github:nepochemu/ytm";
```

Then update and rebuild:

```bash
nix flake update ytm
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos
```

The binary will be available globally as `ytm`.

---

### Non-Nix systems simple install

Download and extract the prebuilt binary:

```bash
curl -L -o ytm-linux-x86_64.tar.gz https://github.com/nepochemu/ytm/releases/download/v0.2.6/ytm-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ytm-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

sudo mv ytm /usr/local/bin/

ytm --version
```


### Non-Nix systems (manual build)

Install dependencies:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev clang mpv fzf
```

**Arch:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel pkgconf openssl mpv fzf
```

Then build and install:

```bash
cargo build --release
cp target/release/ytm ~/.local/bin/
```


**macOS (Homebrew)**

You can install **ytm** on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap nepochemu/ytm https://github.com/nepochemu/ytm
brew install ytm
```

This will download the correct prebuilt binary for your Mac (arm64 for Apple Silicon, x86_64 for Intel).

## Usage


### First run

The first time you run `ytm`, you will be prompted for an API key.  
You can also set or update it manually:

```bash
ytm --api <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Interactive search and play

```bash
ytm portishead third
```

- Opens `fzf` with top 50 results (videos + playlists).
- Select an item â†’ plays immediately in `mpv`.

### Video mode

```bash
ytm -v portishead third
```

- Same as above, but forces `mpv` to open video window.

### Background playback mode

```bash
ytm -b portishead third
```

- Starts playback in background and returns to terminal
- Shows track information and playlist position  
- Control with: `ytm next`, `ytm prev`, `ytm pause`, `ytm resume`, `ytm stop`, `ytm status`
- Can be combined with `-v` flag: `ytm -b -v portishead third`

### Playlists

If you select a playlist in `fzf` (shown with `[playlist]`), `ytm` will fetch all its videos and queue them in `mpv`.

Playback is controlled directly inside `mpv`:

- **Next video** â†’ `>` (Shift + `.`)  
- **Previous video** â†’ `<` (Shift + `,`)  
- **Pause / Resume** â†’ `SPACE`  
- **Quit** â†’ `q`

This works the same for both normal videos and playlists, but with playlists you can skip forward/back through the queue.



### Update API key

```bash
ytm --api <YOUR_API_KEY>
```
